# Nodule Detection Algorithm

This codebase implements our final solution for the nodule detection track in [NODE21](https://node21.grand-challenge.org/). 
It contains files to build a docker image which can be submitted as an algorithm on the [grand-challenge](https://www.grand-challenge.org) platform. The final algorithm can be found [here](https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/final-submission-mtec/).

The code in this repository is based on [this](https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/final-submission-mtec/) template repository with docker and evalutils.
